Beaverhacks Fall 2021: Quarterly hackathon with theme focused on climate change/energy

This program reads the attached graph text file to extract the necessary data points of years and corresponding
global land-ocean temperature indices. The text file contains records of the global land-ocean temperature index for 
each year since 1880. The temperature index indicates relative changes in temperature during that year. A positive 
index indicates relative warmth, whereas a negative index indicates relative coolness. This data was obtained from NASA, 
at the following webpage: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/. 

After extracting the relevant data, this program then uses the matplotlib  package to generate a graph of the data as 
a scatter plot with a corresponding trend line which will show that the average global temperature has been rising 
steadily since 1880, most notably within the last 20-40 years.
